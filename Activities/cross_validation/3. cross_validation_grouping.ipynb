    "# Cross-Validation with Sample Grouping\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore the concept of **sample groups** in cross-validation and why they are crucial for obtaining reliable model performance estimates. We'll use the handwritten digits dataset to demonstrate some surprising results that highlight the importance of proper data splitting strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will understand:\n",
    "- What sample grouping means in the context of cross-validation\n",
    "- How data leakage can occur when groups are not properly handled\n",
    "- The difference between optimistic and realistic performance estimates\n",
    "- When and how to use group-aware cross-validation techniques\n",
    "- Real-world scenarios where grouping is essential\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Sample Grouping?\n",
    "Sample grouping refers to the situation where certain samples in your dataset are related or dependent on each other. These relationships can arise from:\n",
    "- **Temporal dependencies**: Data collected over time from the same source\n",
    "- **Individual subjects**: Multiple measurements from the same person/entity\n",
    "- **Hierarchical structures**: Data from the same institution, location, or category\n",
    "- **Data collection methodology**: Samples processed in the same batch or session\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does this matter?** If related samples end up in both training and test sets, your model might learn to recognize the underlying patterns of specific groups rather than generalizing to new, unseen groups. This leads to overly optimistic performance estimates that don't reflect real-world performance."

    "2. **Realistic Performance Estimates**: Lower but honest scores are better than optimistic but misleading ones\n",

    "### When Should You Consider Grouping?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definitely use grouping when you have:**\n",
    "- **Time series data**: Multiple measurements from the same time period or entity\n",
    "- **Medical data**: Multiple samples/visits from the same patient\n",
    "- **Image data**: Multiple images from the same person, object, or scene\n",
    "- **Text data**: Multiple documents from the same author or source\n",
    "- **Sensor data**: Multiple readings from the same device or location\n",
    "- **Financial data**: Multiple transactions from the same customer or account\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions to ask yourself:**\n",
    "- Are there natural clusters or relationships in my data?\n",
    "- Could samples from the same source appear in both training and test sets?\n",
    "- Does my model need to generalize to completely new entities/sources?\n",
    "- Would domain experts consider certain samples as \"related\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Group-Aware Strategies\n",
    "Besides `GroupKFold`, scikit-learn provides:\n",
    "- `LeaveOneGroupOut`: Use each group as a test set once\n",
    "- `LeavePGroupsOut`: Use P groups as test set in each fold  \n",
    "- `GroupShuffleSplit`: Random sampling while respecting groups\n",
    "- `StratifiedGroupKFold`: Stratified sampling with group constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Impact\n",
    "Proper cross-validation with grouping:\n",
    "- âœ… Provides reliable performance estimates\n",
    "- âœ… Prevents deployment of overoptimistic models  \n",
    "- âœ… Builds trust in machine learning systems\n",
    "- âœ… Reduces the risk of model failures in production\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: **It's better to have a realistic estimate of 85% accuracy than a misleading estimate of 95% accuracy!**\n",
