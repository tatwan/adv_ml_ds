# Regularization

In this activity, you'll use regularized linear regression models to predict the housing prices of buildings in Tehran.

## Instructions

Use the starter file [Regularized_Regressions.ipynb](Unsolved/Regularized_Regressions.ipynb) and [residential-building.csv](Resources/residential-building.csv) dataset with this activity.

For each of the following four regression models, import the model from scikit-learn, fit the model to the data, and then print the model's score:

* Linear regression
* LASSO
* Ridge
* ElasticNet
